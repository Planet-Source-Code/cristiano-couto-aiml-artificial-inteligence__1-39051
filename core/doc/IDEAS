For topics -
  create another topic file called topic.txt
  the first thing we have in this file.. is a list of topics..  and
  their tpos in the file.
  then further on down we have the patterns and templates for the
topics..

  what we do.. is if the topic isn't our normal one..  we start going
through topic.txt, if we find a match in the topic list above..  we sort
through those patterns and templates..

if we don't find a match.. then nothing.

but we do all this after we have searched through our normal stuff.
What were looking for.. is another match that's EXACTLY the same as the
match we got in our normal patterns and templates.

For <that index = 1> - 
  one of these days, we'll have to put logging into the core, when that
happens, we can use these logs to look up what our past that's were..
since this shouldn't happen that often, it wouldn't me that much of a
waste of time.
