The following people have made significant contributions to the C-alice project.

Dr. Wallace <dr.wallace@mindspring.com> originally created alice, wrote
the original CGI code for C alice, wrote classify.c donated the
hippie.alicebot.com website, and gave much needed advice and support. 
Without him, there would be no alice. 

Jacco Bikker <Phantom@goright.to> wrote the original C code that this version
is based on. Much of the code inside alice_core is still his.  He has also given
much needed advice, and explainations. 

Kris Northern <knorthern@outlook.net> created web graphics and a page layout for
hippie. It has been said that hippie.alicebot.com is the best looking page in
the alicebot.com domain.  This we owe to him. 

Philippe Raxhon <praxhon@crl.be> provided many bug fixes, and code suggestions,
and also came up with the idea and implementation of init files for
C-alice.  He also regularly checks for windows compatibility.

Terry Welch <malatesa@lemoorenet.com> provided an eggdrop script that now
is used with command alice.  He also started work on ICQ Alice which I
hope to get completed soon.  He also created the cl_search.tcl minibot.

Chicoine Rejean <komodo36@hotmail.com> modified the eggdrop script so
that it worked with private messages and when the bots name is called.

Stephen Logan <slogan@stephenlogan.com> provided a perl script that uses command
alice for IRC.

Jedi Striker <jedi1@ig.com.br> provided a TCP/IP version of Alice.

Kirk Munoz provided new aiml content in ology1.aiml.

David Maggins continues to ask questions that make me go "hmm."  

Sage Greco created Smilee's graphics.

Diana Andreacchio <andria1@mindspring.com> contributed the srai explanation in
the AIML mini primer.

Sergey Bogdanov <desprojects@yahoo.com> cleaned up stuff.cpp considerably.

Thanks to all those at equality.ipa.net who helped me beta-test and check
for bugs.

Many people contributed to the Java alice project, and their contributions have
had an effect on the C alice project.  You can view their contributions at

A special thanks to all those on the message list, and those who ran C alice and
found bugs.
