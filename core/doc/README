See BUGS for bugs Ive found but haven't been able to/ got around to fixing.

See TODO for things I've been meaning to do, but am too lazy :)

See CHANGES for things that have changed since the beggining.  (not entirely
100% complete but I tried my best to keep it up to date)

There are several things to note with this version of C alice.

- There is a file C.aiml that needs to be present.  This file isn't an actual
aiml file.  It's simply an index of the aiml files you want to load up.  put
in the path and filename of the aiml files you want loaded in there, seperated
by CRLF

for example:

alice/Atomic.aiml
alice/69Percent.aiml
....
.... (more files in here)
....
alice/Brain.aiml


-There's really only 4 functions you need to use in any alice interface.
loadvars(filename);
savevars(filesname);
respond(text);
initialize();

-a super simple program using alice would be.

initialize();
loadvars(users_ip);

while (user_is_still_talking_to_alice) {
  get_string(user_response);
  alices_answer = respond(user_response);
  print_out(alices_answer);
}

savevars(users_ip);  

-loadvars() and savevars() can have any file name.  But for multiple users,
you want a seperate var file for each user.  So pick something unique. (IP
address, user name, e-mail address, etc.)  For single user applications.  Pick
something static, such as loadvars("data/localhost.txt") and
savevars("data/localhost.txt") 

-There is a make file that should help compiling on unix systems.  Type 'make
help' for details.
